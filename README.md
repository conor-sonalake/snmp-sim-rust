# Pre-requisite

To only compile the application manually you'll need to install:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make#installation)

To use the automated build/test tools, we recommend that you install:

- [Brew](https://brew.sh/)

Once Brew is installed, you can install both  `docker` and GNU `make`:

```bash
brew install docker make
```

Since macOS provides an older version of GNU `make` (v3.81 dated April 1, 2006),
we recommend installing and using `gmake`, which provides numerous features and
performance enhancements.

To use containerization platform, we recommend that you instasll:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


For testing purposes, we recommend that you install:

- [Net-SNMP package](http://www.net-snmp.org/)

# How to build

## Using `cargo`

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Build the application and its container-image by using `make` (or `gmake`):

```bash
make
```

The deafult is to compile the application in debug-mode. If you want to build a
release-mode binary, then set the `RELEASE_OR_DEBUG` flag to `release`:

```bash
make RELEASE_OR_DEBUG=release
```


## Using `docker`
```bash
docker build -t snmp-sim .
```

```bash
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8161:8161/udp --name snmp-sim -t snmp-sim &
```

```bash
docker stop snmp-sim
```

## Using `docker-compose`

```bash
docker-compose build
```

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

```bash
docker-compose down
```


# How to run the tests using `cargo`

The following command will invoke doc, unit-tests and integration-tests execution:

```bash
cargo test
```

# Testing using `snmpget`

The `snmp-sim` can be also tested by an external tool `snmpget`:

```bash
snmpget -v1 -c public localhost:8161 .1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.14.11.5.1.1.2
snmpget -v2c -c public localhost:8161 .1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.14.11.5.1.1.2
snmpget -v3 -c public localhost:8161 .1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.14.11.5.1.1.2
```
